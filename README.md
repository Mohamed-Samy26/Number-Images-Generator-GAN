# Number Image Generation using GANs

## Introduction

This project is about generating images of numbers using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The dataset used is the MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The images are grayscale and 28x28 pixels. The goal is to generate images that look like the numbers in the dataset.

## GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning systems invented by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator is trained to recognize the difference between real data and the data created by the generator.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are grayscale and 28x28 pixels.

## Results

The images generated by the GANs are not perfect, but they are recognizable as numbers. The quality of the images can be improved by training the GANs for more epochs and using a larger dataset.

## Conclusion

In this project, we used GANs to generate images of numbers. The images generated by the GANs are not perfect, but they are recognizable as numbers. The quality of the images can be improved by training the GANs for more epochs and using a larger dataset.
